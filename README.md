# rust-g

rust-g (pronounced rusty-g) is a library which offloads certain expensive or
difficult tasks from BYOND.

This library is currently used in the [tgstation] codebase, and is required for
it to run. A pre-compiled DLL version can be found in the repo root, but you
can build your own from this repo at your preference. Builds can also be found
on the [releases page].

## Dependencies

The [Rust] compiler:

1. Install the Rust compiler's dependencies (primarily the system linker):

   * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib`
   * Windows (MSVC): [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017][msvc]
   * Windows (GNU): No action required

1. Use [the Rust installer](https://rustup.rs/), or another Rust installation method,
   or run the following:

    ```sh
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSfo rustup-init.sh
    chmod +x rustup-init.sh
    ./rustup-init.sh
    ```

1. Set the default compiler to **32-bit**:

    ```sh
    # Clone the `rust-g` repository to a directory of your choice
    git clone https://github.com/tgstation/rust-g.git
    # in the `rust-g` directory...
    cd rust-g
    # Linux
    rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu
    # Windows
    rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
    ```

System libraries:

* Ubuntu and Debian users run:

    ```sh
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev:i386 libssl-dev:i386 pkg-config:i386
    ```

* Other distributions install the appropriate **32-bit development** and **32-bit runtime** packages.

## Compiling

The [cargo] tool handles compilation, as well as automatically downloading and
compiling all Rust dependencies. The default configuration is suitable for
use with the [tgstation] codebase. To compile in release mode (recommended for
speed):

```sh
# Linux
cargo build --release --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu
# Windows
cargo build --release --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

On Linux, the output will be `target/release/librust_g.so`.

On Windows, the output will be `target/release/rust_g.dll`.

For more advanced configuration, a list of modules may be passed:

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1
# Linux
cargo build --release --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --features dmi,file,log,url,http
# Windows
cargo build --release --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc --features dmi,file,log,url,http
```

The default features are:
* log: Faster log output.
* dmi: DMI manipulations which are impossible from within BYOND.
  Used by the asset cache subsystem to improve load times.
* git: Functions for robustly checking the current git revision.
* http: Asynchronous HTTP(s) client supporting most standard methods.
* sql: Asynchronous MySQL/MariaDB client library.
* noise: 2d Perlin noise.

Additional features are:
* url: Faster replacements for `url_encode` and `url_decode`.
* file: Faster replacements for `file2text` and `text2file`, as well as reading or checking if files exist.
* hash: Faster replacement for `md5`, support for SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512. Requires OpenSSL on Linux.

## Installing

The rust-g binary (`rust_g.dll` or `librust_g.so`) should be placed in the root
of your repository next to your `.dmb`. There are alternative installation
locations, but this one is best supported.

Compiling will also create the file `target/rust_g.dm` which contains the DM API
of the enabled modules. To use rust-g, copy-paste this file into your project.

`rust_g.dm` can be configured by creating a `rust_g.config.dm`. See the comments
at the top of `rust_g.dm` for details.

## Troubleshooting

You must build a 32-bit version of the library for it to be compatible with
BYOND. Attempting to build a 64-bit version will fail with an explanatory error.
Use the `rustup override add` command described above or build with `--target`.

### Linux

On Linux systems `ldd` can be used to check that the relevant runtime libraries
are installed, without which BYOND will fail to load rust-g. The following is
sample output, but the most important thing is that nothing is listed as
"missing".

```sh
$ ldd librust_g.so  # Linux
    linux-gate.so.1 (0xf7f45000)
    libssl.so.1.1 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.1 (0xf6c79000)
    libcrypto.so.1.1 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0xf69cd000)
    libdl.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0xf69c8000)
    librt.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0xf69be000)
    libpthread.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0xf699f000)
    libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0xf6981000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xf67a5000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf7f47000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0xf66a3000)
```

If BYOND cannot find the shared library, ensure that the directory containing
it is included in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, or tweak the search
logic in `rust_g.dm`:

```sh
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/tgstation
```

To examine what locations BYOND is searching for the shared library, use
`strace`:

```sh
$ strace DreamDaemon tgstation.dmb 45000 -trusted -logself 2>&1 | grep 'rust_g'
# Early in output, the file will be listed when BYOND examines every file it can see:
open("rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
# BYOND will then search some common directories...
stat64("/home/game/.byond/bin/rust_g", 0xffef1110) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
stat64("/home/game/.byond/bin/rust_g", 0xffef1190) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
# Then anywhere in LD_LIBRARY_PATH...
open("/home/game/work/ss13/byond/bin/rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
# Then in several interesting places where ld-linux looks...
open("tls/i686/sse2/cmov/rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    ... snip ...
open("cmov/rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
# Until finding the library fails or succeeds (a value other than -1 indicates success):
open("rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC)      = 4
# After that it goes back to the scanning from startup.
open("rust_g", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
```

If you're still having problems, ask in the [Coderbus Discord]'s
`#tooling-questions` channel.

You can also try [tgstation]'s IRC, `#coderbus` on Rizon, but it is usually
quiet.
